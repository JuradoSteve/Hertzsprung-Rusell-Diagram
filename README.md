# Hertzsprung-Rusell-Diagram

This code generate a [Hertzsprung-Rusell diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertzsprung%E2%80%93Russell_diagram) from a stellar astrophysics homework based in the text [An Introduction to Modern Astrophysics (2nd Edition) - Bradley W. Carroll & Dale A. Ostile](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Modern-Astrophysics-2nd/dp/0805304029).

The homework's taks were:

> The main sequence present an aproximate mass-luminosity relation as $L \propto M^{7/2}$ and a radius-mass relation as $R \propto M^{4/5}$.

1. With the before relations you can graph the main sequence in an Hertzsprung-Rusell theoretical diagram (HRD). Your HRD should cover the range 3.5 - 4.5 for 
https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\log{T_{eff}}$\log{T_{eff}}$ and a appropiate range for $\log{L/L_{\odot}}$. Hint: Derivate first a expresion for $L$ in $T_{eff}$ terms for stars in main sequences.

We now that the relation between the luminosity and the effective temperature for a star is:

$$L = 4\pi R_{\star} \sigma T_{eff}^{4}$$
if we divided with the Sun's values:
$$\frac{L}{L_{\odot}} = \frac{4\pi R_{\star} \sigma T_{eff}^{4}}{4\pi R_{\odot} \sigma T_{eff,{\odot}}^{4}}$$
